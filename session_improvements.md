Hi Claude,

I want you to help me realise some features I have been thinking about for a while.

## Predefined Default Workspaces/Sessions

I would like to have a predefined set of workspaces/sessions that I can switch to quickly with a keybinding.
For example:

Workspace 1: Default Session. This is already the normal behavior. We can keep this as is and would also serve as a Scratchpad. (cmd+1)
Workspace 2: Private Notes. This should start in this directory: `~/repos/nikbrunner/notes/` and in best case should enter it with `nvim`. (cmd+2)
Workspace 3: Work Notes. This should start in this directory: `~/repos/nikbrunner/dcd-notes/` and in best case should enter it with `nvim`. (cmd+3)

After that, I can start sessions with the Sessionizer as needed.
